# Feature Specification: ESLint Configuration and Code Quality System

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-the-latest`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add the latest version of eslint and it's configuration files to setup my project with an npm run lint that will run linting for hte project. Taking into account the fact thatits a workspace project. Look at how we did the typescript tsconfig setup as well."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on a TypeScript npm workspace, I need automated code linting that enforces consistent code quality standards and catches potential issues, so that I can maintain high code quality across all packages and ensure consistent coding practices throughout the project.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** JavaScript/TypeScript files with code quality issues, **When** I run the lint command, **Then** all issues are detected and reported with specific file locations and error descriptions
2. **Given** code that follows the project's linting rules, **When** the lint command runs, **Then** no errors are reported and the command completes successfully
3. **Given** a workspace with multiple packages, **When** the lint command executes, **Then** linting occurs across all packages in the repository
4. **Given** continuous integration environment, **When** the lint command is executed, **Then** the build pipeline fails if any linting errors are detected
5. **Given** code with auto-fixable linting issues, **When** I run the lint command with fix option, **Then** supported issues are automatically corrected

### Edge Cases

- What happens when linting configuration files have syntax errors?
- How does the system handle conflicting linting rules between packages?
- What occurs when there are very large files that slow down the linting process?
- How are custom rules and plugins handled across different workspace packages?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide base linting configuration that defines shared code quality standards for the workspace
- **FR-002**: System MUST support package-specific linting configurations that extend the base rules
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a single executable command that triggers comprehensive linting across all workspace packages
- **FR-004**: System MUST detect and report code quality issues, style violations, and potential bugs with specific file locations
- **FR-005**: System MUST exit with appropriate status codes to indicate success or failure of linting validation
- **FR-006**: System MUST support workspace-level linting that encompasses multiple packages or modules
- **FR-007**: System MUST integrate with existing development workflows and follow the established script naming patterns
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide options for automatically fixing supported linting violations
- **FR-009**: System MUST support modern JavaScript and TypeScript syntax and features
- **FR-010**: System MUST respect existing project structure and build upon the TypeScript configuration pattern established
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear and actionable error messages when linting issues are found
- **FR-012**: System MUST support integration with code editors and development environments for real-time feedback

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Linting Configuration Files**: Define code quality rules, style guidelines, and error detection settings that govern code standards across the workspace
- **Lint Command**: Executable script that orchestrates the linting process across all repository packages following the established `npm run lint` pattern
- **Quality Reports**: Generated output containing details about code quality violations, style issues, and potential bugs with actionable feedback
- **Workspace Structure**: Organization of JavaScript/TypeScript files and packages that need coordinated linting validation, building on the existing tsconfig pattern
