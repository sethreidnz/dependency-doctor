# Data Model: ESLint Configuration System

## Configuration Entities

### Base ESLint Configuration
**Purpose**: Defines workspace-wide linting standards and shared rules
**Location**: `/eslint.config.js`
**Structure**:
- File patterns for different file types (TypeScript, JavaScript, test files)
- Parser configuration (@typescript-eslint/parser)
- Plugin integrations (@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin)
- Base rule sets (recommended, strict, type-checked)
- Environment settings (Node.js, ES modules)

**Attributes**:
- `files`: Array of glob patterns for file targeting
- `languageOptions`: Parser and environment configuration
- `plugins`: ESLint plugin registrations
- `rules`: Rule definitions and severity levels
- `settings`: Additional configuration for plugins

### Package-Specific Configuration
**Purpose**: Extends base configuration with package-specific overrides
**Location**: `/packages/{package-name}/eslint.config.js`
**Structure**:
- Imports base configuration
- Package-specific rule overrides
- File-specific configurations (e.g., test files, build scripts)
- Custom environment settings if needed

**Attributes**:
- `extends`: Reference to base configuration
- `files`: Package-specific file patterns
- `rules`: Rule overrides and additions
- `env`: Package-specific environment settings

### Linting Command Configuration
**Purpose**: Defines how linting is executed across the workspace
**Location**: `/package.json` scripts section
**Structure**:
- Root-level command (`npm run lint`)
- Package-specific commands (`npm run mcp:lint`)
- Command parameters (cache, config path, file patterns)

**Attributes**:
- `command`: ESLint CLI command with flags
- `config`: Path to configuration file
- `cache`: Cache location and settings
- `files`: Target file patterns
- `workspaces`: Workspace targeting strategy

## Rule Configuration Model

### Rule Definition Structure
```javascript
{
  "rule-name": "severity-level",  // "error" | "warn" | "off"
  "rule-with-options": ["severity", { options }]
}
```

### Rule Categories
1. **TypeScript-Specific Rules**: Type checking, type safety, TypeScript syntax
2. **Code Quality Rules**: Complexity, best practices, potential bugs
3. **Style Rules**: Formatting, naming conventions, code organization
4. **Import/Export Rules**: Module resolution, dependency management

## Workspace Structure Model

### File Organization
```
/
├── eslint.config.js                    # Base configuration
├── .eslintcache                       # ESLint cache file
├── packages/
│   └── dependency-doctor/
│       ├── eslint.config.js           # Package overrides
│       └── src/                       # Linted source files
└── package.json                       # Linting scripts
```

### Configuration Inheritance
1. **Base Level**: Workspace-wide standards in root config
2. **Package Level**: Package-specific overrides and additions
3. **File Level**: File-pattern-specific rules within packages

## Validation Rules

### Configuration Validation
- All configuration files must be valid JavaScript modules
- Base configuration must export default array of config objects
- Package configurations must properly extend base configuration
- Rule conflicts between base and package configs must be explicitly handled

### File Targeting Validation
- File patterns must not overlap inappropriately between configurations
- All TypeScript files must be covered by appropriate configuration
- Test files may have relaxed rules compared to source files
- Build/config files may have specific rule exemptions

### Command Validation
- All npm scripts must use valid ESLint CLI syntax
- Configuration file paths must be correct and accessible
- Cache directory must be writable
- Workspace targeting must include all relevant packages

## State Transitions

### Configuration Loading
1. **Discovery**: ESLint discovers configuration files in hierarchical order
2. **Inheritance**: Package configs extend base configuration
3. **Merging**: Rules are merged with package overrides taking precedence
4. **Validation**: Final configuration is validated for conflicts

### Linting Execution
1. **File Discovery**: ESLint identifies files matching configuration patterns
2. **Rule Application**: Appropriate rules are applied based on file type and location
3. **Error Collection**: Violations are collected with file locations and rule names
4. **Result Reporting**: Results are formatted and reported to user

### Cache Management
1. **Cache Check**: ESLint checks for existing cache of file analysis
2. **Incremental Analysis**: Only changed files are re-analyzed
3. **Cache Update**: Results are stored for subsequent runs
4. **Cache Invalidation**: Cache is cleared when configuration changes

## Integration Points

### TypeScript Integration
- Configuration must reference appropriate tsconfig.json files
- Parser options must align with TypeScript compiler settings
- Type-aware rules require project configuration paths

### IDE Integration
- Configuration must be discoverable by editor ESLint extensions
- Workspace settings must point to correct configuration files
- Auto-fix capabilities must be properly configured

### CI/CD Integration
- Linting commands must exit with appropriate status codes
- Error output must be machine-readable for CI systems
- Performance must be optimized for automated environments

This data model provides the foundation for implementing a robust, scalable ESLint configuration system that follows the established workspace patterns and supports the development workflow requirements.
