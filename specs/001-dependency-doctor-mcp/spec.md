# Feature Specification: Dependency Doctor MCP MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-dependency-doctor-mcp`  
**Created**: 2025-01-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A local MCP server for helping a user upgrade packages in their repository. The initial mvp will use npm as a starting point but the solution should be pluggable and extendable so that other people not familiar with the MCP server could implement what is needed to carry out the same steps but with their package manager and language.

This MCP tool should focus on the high-level steps that are require to carry out an upgrade for a given codebase. This sort of process would involve

1. Running commands to identify outdated or vulnerable (CVEs) package
2. Running commands to identify relationships between outdated packages and providing the LLM with context to group the package upgrade for easier upgrading
3. Processing the raw format from the cli (npm for starters) to try to create a condensed view of the packages, groupings and notes about it for use by teh LLM and later steps
4. Priorities user interactions and doing things collaboratively to avoid issues
5. Workspace settings file so that users can provide more info to the MCP server, for example validation command to run (e.g. npm run validate)
6. The tool should use a special folder and markdown files to write out summaries and information for ongoing maintenance and update this stuff as things change and the user does work

The basic features would be:

- Analyse - As a user I want to be able to to a high-level analysis of my repository and it's dependencies for a given package manager. I want this to produce artifacts in the repository that give an up to date and organised view of the dependency updates required in the repository.
- As a user I want to be able to interactively upgrade a particular library in an automated fashion to make upgrading as easy and safe as possible with as minimal user input as possible"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A developer working on a codebase wants to safely upgrade outdated or vulnerable packages in their repository. They interact with an MCP server that analyzes their dependencies, identifies upgrade opportunities, groups related packages for efficient upgrading, and guides them through the upgrade process collaboratively to minimize risk and maximize success.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a repository with outdated packages, **When** the user requests dependency analysis, **Then** the system identifies all outdated packages and presents them in a prioritized, grouped format with upgrade recommendations
2. **Given** identified outdated packages, **When** the user selects a specific package or group for upgrade, **Then** the system guides them through an interactive upgrade process with safety checks and validation
3. **Given** packages with known security vulnerabilities (CVEs), **When** the system performs analysis, **Then** vulnerable packages are prioritized and flagged with security risk information
4. **Given** complex dependency relationships, **When** analyzing packages, **Then** the system groups related packages together and explains the relationships to help users make informed upgrade decisions
5. **Given** an ongoing upgrade session, **When** the user makes changes, **Then** the system maintains documentation and summaries of the upgrade progress in dedicated workspace files

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a package upgrade would break compatibility with other dependencies?
- How does the system handle packages that have been deprecated or have no clear upgrade path?
- What occurs when validation commands fail after an upgrade?
- How does the system respond when multiple users are working on the same repository simultaneously?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST identify outdated packages in a repository by scanning package manifests and comparing with available versions
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify packages with known security vulnerabilities (CVEs) and flag them with appropriate risk levels
- **FR-003**: System MUST analyze dependency relationships between packages to group logically related upgrades together
- **FR-004**: System MUST present upgrade information in a condensed, LLM-friendly format that highlights key upgrade decisions and potential impacts
- **FR-005**: System MUST support interactive, collaborative upgrade processes that allow users to make informed decisions at each step
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain workspace configuration files where users can specify custom validation commands and project-specific settings
- **FR-007**: System MUST create and maintain documentation in dedicated workspace folders, including upgrade summaries, progress tracking, and maintenance notes
- **FR-008**: System MUST support pluggable package manager integration, starting with npm but extensible to other package managers [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific requirements for extensibility - what interface or plugin system should be used?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST prioritize user safety by providing preview capabilities and rollback options before making actual changes
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate upgrades using user-configured validation commands before finalizing changes
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle workspace settings persistence across sessions [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: where should settings be stored and what format should be used?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support both individual package upgrades and batch upgrade operations for efficiency

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Package**: Represents a dependency in the repository with current version, available versions, security status, and relationship information
- **Upgrade Group**: A collection of related packages that should be considered together for upgrade decisions, with rationale for the grouping
- **Vulnerability Report**: Information about security vulnerabilities (CVEs) affecting specific package versions, including severity and remediation guidance
- **Upgrade Session**: A collaborative upgrade process with progress tracking, decisions made, and outcomes achieved
- **Workspace Configuration**: User-defined settings including validation commands, upgrade preferences, and project-specific rules
- **Upgrade Documentation**: Markdown-based summaries and maintenance records stored in the workspace for ongoing reference
