# Research: Dependency Doctor MCP MVP

## Phase 0 Technical Research Results

### 1. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Implementation in TypeScript

**Decision**: Use xmcp framework with TypeScript decorators for tool and resource registration  
**Rationale**: xmcp provides type-safe MCP server implementation with declarative patterns that integrate well with TypeScript workspace  
**Alternatives considered**: Direct MCP protocol implementation (too complex), other MCP frameworks (less TypeScript-focused)

**Key Implementation Patterns**:
- Server class with `@McpTool` and `@McpResource` decorators
- Async tool handlers with structured input/output types
- Resource handlers for workspace configuration and documentation
- Error handling with MCP-compliant error responses

**Code Pattern**:
```typescript
@McpTool({
  name: "analyze_dependencies",
  description: "Analyze repository dependencies for updates and vulnerabilities"
})
async analyzeDependencies(args: AnalyzeArgs): Promise<AnalysisResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### 2. npm CLI Programmatic Integration

**Decision**: Use child_process.spawn with structured output parsing  
**Rationale**: Provides reliable npm command execution with stream handling for large dependency trees  
**Alternatives considered**: npm programmatic API (unstable), third-party npm wrappers (additional dependencies)

**Key Patterns**:
- `npm audit --json` for vulnerability detection
- `npm outdated --json` for outdated package identification  
- `npm list --json --depth=0` for dependency tree analysis
- Stream-based parsing for large repositories

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Handle npm command failures gracefully
- Parse JSON output with schema validation
- Support both local and global npm configurations
- Cache results for performance optimization

### 3. Package Manager Plugin Architecture

**Decision**: Interface-based plugin system with async factory pattern  
**Rationale**: Allows clean separation of package manager implementations while maintaining type safety  
**Alternatives considered**: Class inheritance (tight coupling), configuration-based (less flexible)

**Plugin Interface**:
```typescript
interface PackageManagerPlugin {
  name: string;
  analyzeOutdated(): Promise<PackageInfo[]>;
  analyzeVulnerabilities(): Promise<VulnerabilityInfo[]>;
  analyzeDependencies(): Promise<DependencyGraph>;
  executeUpgrade(packages: PackageUpgrade[]): Promise<UpgradeResult>;
}
```

**Registration Pattern**:
- Plugin discovery via file system scanning
- Dynamic import of plugin modules
- Plugin validation during server startup

### 4. Workspace Configuration Management

**Decision**: JSON configuration with markdown documentation generation  
**Rationale**: JSON provides structured configuration, markdown enables rich documentation that integrates with development workflows  
**Alternatives considered**: YAML (parsing complexity), TOML (less ecosystem support)

**Configuration Structure**:
- `.dependency-doctor/config.json` for workspace settings
- `.dependency-doctor/docs/` for generated documentation
- `.dependency-doctor/sessions/` for upgrade session state

**File Management Patterns**:
- Atomic file operations for configuration updates
- Template-based markdown generation
- Backup and restore for configuration changes
- Watch-based configuration reloading

### 5. Security and Vulnerability Detection

**Decision**: Multi-source vulnerability detection with npm audit primary, additional CVE database integration  
**Rationale**: npm audit provides reliable base, additional sources improve coverage  
**Alternatives considered**: Single source (limited coverage), third-party only (dependency concerns)

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Primary: npm audit for npm ecosystem vulnerabilities
- Secondary: GitHub Advisory Database for comprehensive CVE data
- Caching layer for vulnerability lookups
- Severity scoring normalization across sources

### 6. Performance Optimization

**Decision**: Streaming analysis with incremental results  
**Rationale**: Large repositories require responsive UX with progressive disclosure  
**Alternatives considered**: Blocking analysis (poor UX), background processing (complexity)

**Optimization Patterns**:
- Stream-based npm command output processing
- Incremental result emission via MCP progress notifications
- Result caching with dependency hash invalidation
- Parallel analysis of independent package groups

### 7. Error Handling and Recovery

**Decision**: Structured error responses with recovery suggestions  
**Rationale**: Provides actionable error information for troubleshooting and recovery  
**Alternatives considered**: Generic errors (poor UX), logging-only (insufficient feedback)

**Error Patterns**:
- MCP-compliant error response structure
- Error categorization (network, parsing, validation, etc.)
- Recovery suggestion generation
- Graceful degradation for partial failures

## Resolution Summary

- ✅ MCP protocol specifications and implementation patterns
- ✅ npm CLI integration approaches  
- ✅ Package vulnerability detection methods
- ✅ TypeScript plugin architecture patterns
- ✅ File system workspace management patterns

**Next Phase**: Design contracts, data models, and implementation structure based on these research findings.
